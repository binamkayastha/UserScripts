# UserScripts
A bunch of userscripts I made (hopefully there will be a bunch in the future)

Each userscript is it's own git repo (submodule) within this repo. If you'd like to clone all the submodules, please remember to set the `--recursive` flag when cloning.

## CompactInbox
Makes the Google inbox much more condense so you can actually see more than 10 emails when you open it up.

## YoutubeLeash
This script simply hides the recommended side bar at the right of the screen when watching videos, as well as the comments section.

## When2Meet
Currently in progress, but the final product is meant to let the user toggle select several names, to see who is free in certain times.
