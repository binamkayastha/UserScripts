# UserScripts
A bunch of userscripts I made (hopefully there will be a bunch in the future)

## YoutubeScripts
This script simply hides the recommended side bar at the right of the screen when watching videos, as well as the comments section.

## When2Meet
Currently in progress, but the final product is meant to let the user toggle select several names, to see who is free in certain times.
