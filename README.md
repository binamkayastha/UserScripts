# UserScripts [Open for Contribution]
A bunch of userscripts I made (hopefully there will be a bunch in the future)

Each userscript is it's own git repo (submodule) within this repo. If you'd like to clone all the submodules, please remember to set the `--recursive` flag when cloning.

## CompactInbox [Outdated/Broken] 
Makes the Google inbox much more condense so you can actually see more than 10 emails when you open it up.

 - [ ] Fix class names for newly compiled google inbox


## When2Meet [In Progress]
Currently in progress, but the final product is meant to let the user toggle select several names, to see who is free in certain times.

 - Feel free to work on it, I never got the time to finish it
